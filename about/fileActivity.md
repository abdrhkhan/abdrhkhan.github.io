title: Food

This page is devoted to my summer research entitled "You are what you eat: A Sustainable Food Project." This summer, I sought out to answer the question: is it possible to live sustainably in today's modern food complex? 
Here, "sustainable" refers to the ability to consistently make food descions leading to positive impacts.
