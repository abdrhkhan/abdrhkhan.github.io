Howdy everyone! 

My name is Abdul Rahman Khan, but a lot of my friends call me AR or ARK. I study Industrial Distribution and am pursuing a minor in CLimate Change and English. Theres a lot of things I enjoy doing, but most of all I love food. If I had an afternoon to myself, I would spend it trying to make a new recipe and then forcing my friends to see if it is any good. For my senior capstone project, I choose to tackle the issue of food insecurity, specifically within college students. The goal of this blog is to go through the ENGL 460 coursework while simultaneously document my research findings. 

I look forward to sharing my experiences with you all!
