About me:
Howdy everyone! My name is Abdurrahman Khan, you can call me AR or ARK! I'm a Senior Industrial Distribution major from Denton, TX. Lately, I've been obsessed with mafia/true crime movies and lore. In the past week alone, I've watched classic crime films directed by Martin Scorsesse, my favorite being **Casino** and **The Departed**. The majority of these films center around the Italian or Irish Mob Families. I've married my with food and movies by attempting to recreate the foods I see in these films, namely pasta which I've started making from scratch. It's pretty easy once you get the egg and flour technique down. 

Purpose: 
ENGL 460 blends my passion of writing with my pursuit of digital publication. As an English minor, I'm afforded the flexibility to take any English class I want. I intentionally sought out 460 to challenge and immerse myself in a study that intimidates me.
