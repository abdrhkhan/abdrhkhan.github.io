I created a page and included 4 images from my summer projects to share. This post is intended to act as my Week 4 hands-on-activity. I'm running into some issues linking my page to my blog post. When I click on the link from github, it takes me to the directed page. However, when I try to publish and view, it has difficulty responding.
