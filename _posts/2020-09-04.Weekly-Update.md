**Reflection**<br/>
This week, we explored the exchanges that occur between technology and user. Alluding to written language, typed text also exhibits elements of writing. Both sequence communication through movements on the keyboard or stroke of the hand. The difference lies in comparison to oral language which can be understood in terms of time. Vocally, words are taken in context and imprinted permanently in memory whereas written text can be manipulated and exist independent of time.

Our definition of data centers around the communication of language through a digital medium. As described, computerized language offers flexibility. Of course, data can be synthesized in more ways than one. Jekyll Markdown drives the GitHub platform as an easy to comprehend software. Normal computer code consists of a series of 1s and 0s which translate to "True" and "False" respectfully. While a computer can understand the numeric number combinations as series of commands and texts, humans need more editing power. The use of database, protocols, and files allow us to maneuver more readily through a workspace. In the end, digital authoring must be simple to interface with so the author can focus their efforts on the writing itself.

Human facing data consists of lists and headings offering a visually aesthetic and digestible frame. The image below offers an example of human facing data:

Here, COVID-19 raw data is filtered and displayed on overlapping line graphs. The original data would have been displayed on rows and columns on a database software such as Microsoft Excel. With digitized conversions, this big data can be differentiated and colorized to create a consumable visualization. The user can even select different options such as "Total cases" or "New deaths per million people." By altering the approach, the same data can tell two different stories. The beauty of digital authoring resides in the ability to draft evolving narratives. Such an option would not be possible in oral language which intends to produce one suspended interpretation.

**Weekly Takeaway:**<br/>
Previous experiences drove my initial understanding of data exchange. Much of the technical content from this week reminded me a lot of my engineering computer science courses. The similarities caught me by surprise as I had always interpreted the difference between computer and written language. When we brought up Walker Ong & his "Orality and Literacy", I began to see the significance of data in relation to English prose. As a non-specialist, the ability to play with digital media positioned me to approach this unexplored writing medium. I would consider typing on the computer to be a writing form. In terms of pure expression, the pixels on my computer screen open a malleable canvas that expands conventional writing technique. Writing is still about making gestures in time. Just as a contemporary writers imprint a specialized "mark", digital writers are able to creatively embody themselves in their online profile forging a bond between themselves and the reader.
